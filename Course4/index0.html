      <!-- The name attribute is used when sending data in a form submission. Different controls respond differently. For example,
      you may have several radio buttons with different id attributes, but the same name. When submitted, there is just the
      one value in the response - the radio button you selected. -->

      </div>
      <!-- Although both elements deliver functionally the same result, I strongly recommend you use <button> over <input>:
      
        Far more explicit and readable. input suggests that the control is editable, or can be edited by the user; button is
        far more explicit in terms of the purpose it serves
        Easier to style in CSS; as mentioned above, FIrefox and IE have quirks in which input[type="submit"] do not display
        correctly in some cases
        Predictable requests: IE has verying behaviours when values are submitted in the POST/GET request to the server
        Markup-friendly; you can nest items, for example, icons, inside the button.
        HTML5, forward-thinking; as developers, it is our responsibility to adopt to the new spec once it is officialized.
        HTML5, as of right now, has been official for over one year now, and has been shown in many cases to boost SEO. -->
